# ActiveBuilder

ActiveBuilder is a simple gem to help you cleaning up your long arguments/params.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_builder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_builder

## Usage

If you don't use builder pattern, maybe you will do like this when you working with long arguments.

```rb
class ParseDateTime
  def initialize(hours, minutes, seconds, day, month, year)
    @hours = hours
    @minutes = minutes
    @seconds = seconds
    @day = day
    @month = month
    @year = year
  end

  def to_s
    "Datetime: #{@hours}:#{@minutes}:#{@seconds} - #{@day} #{@month} #{@year}"
  end
end

ParseDateTime.new(10, 11, 12, 'Monday', 'November', 2019).to_s
# > "Datetime: 10:11:12 - Monday November 2019"
```

But if use builder pattern you can do like this.

```rb
class DateTimeBuilder
  include ActiveBuilder

  attributes :hours
  attributes :minutes
  attributes :seconds
  attributes :day
  attributes :month
  attributes :year
end

class ParseDateTime
  def initialize(date_time)
    @date_time = date_time
  end

  def to_s
    "Datetime: #{@date_time.hours}:#{@date_time.minutes}:#{@date_time.seconds} \
- #{@date_time.day} #{@date_time.month} #{@date_time.year}"
  end
end

date_time = DateTimeBuilder.new
                           .with_hours(10)
                           .with_minutes(50)
                           .with_seconds(12)
                           .with_day('Monday')
                           .with_month('December')
                           .with_year(2019)
ParseDateTime.new(date_time).to_s
# > "Datetime: 10:11:12 - Monday November 2019"
```

With builder pattern you don't worry with order position parameter again. Also it's more easy to modify and read.
